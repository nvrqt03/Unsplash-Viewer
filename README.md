# Unsplash-Viewer


### This project follows Coding In Flow. The purpose is purely to help learn Kotlin - understand differences to Java, syntax, and other differences.

### This app is 100% Kotlin. We will be learning about and using:

- MVVM architecture
- Paging 3 library
- Glide
- Retrofit
- Navigation
- View Binding
- Dagger Hilt
- Coroutines

We will be accessing the Unsplash API. Our app will take user input to be able to search the API for images, then using RecyclerView we will display these images.
